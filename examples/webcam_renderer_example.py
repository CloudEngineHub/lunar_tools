Webcam Renderer Example

This example demonstrates how to capture images from a webcam and display them
in real-time using the lunar_tools renderer. It combines the WebCam input 
functionality with the Renderer output functionality.

Features:
- Real-time webcam capture
- Live display using OpenGL renderer
- FPS tracking for performance monitoring
- Graceful shutdown on keyboard interrupt

Usage:
    python webcam_renderer_example.py

Controls:
    - Press Ctrl+C to exit
